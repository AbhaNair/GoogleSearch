I made this project to play around with flex-box and strengthen my understanding of the same.
I've used basic HTML paired with CSS, as previously mentioned i've mainly made use of flex-box which was the main intent of pursuing and completing this project.
It has helped clear my understanding on how to approach the design of a page and has helped my create a mental map of how to kick off a similar project in the future.
